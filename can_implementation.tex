In order to spoof the onboard GPS, the CAN-bus was chosen as input to AQ. 
The CAN-bus is already implemented and widely used on a ViaCopter drone to communicate between AQ and hardware like ESCs, PDB etc. Much time was spend reading through the source code and trying to figure out how the protocol works.
The developers behind AQ says, that the code is the documentation and thereby have not written any real documentation. \\
Figuring out how it works was done using debugging utilities such as breakpoints and looking at the content of the different memory locations in CrossWorks.\\
More debugging tricks can be seen in appendix \ref{app:debugging}. 
To further investigate the protocol a PEAK-CAN adapter were connected to a Ladybird drone and several python scripts were developed to send and receive messages from AQ. \\
The author did not go into details about messages used between AQ $\leftrightarrow$ ESC's and AQ $\leftrightarrow$ OSD.\\
