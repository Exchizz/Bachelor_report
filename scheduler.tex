\textit{This capter concerns only the Atmega.  The ESP module will be descriped in section \ref{sec:esp_firmware}} \\
In order to have a timing on the At90CAN128 a scheduler was chosen and implemented.
The list below shows 3 different types of scheduler that was considered.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-time Operating System(RTOS) provides strict timing but at the cost of overhead. A RTOS runs task in a "parallel" environment. Each task runs in a loop and the RTOS scheduler will do context switching when needed. Using a RTOS requires mutexes and semaphores to protect shared resources which increases the complexity and amount of overhead
	\item Super-Loop provides no timing at all, but process data as fast as possible. It does not do any context switching and does not require mutexes or semaphores and  and thereby takes no overhead.
	\item Run-To-Complete(RTCS) scheduler is a mix of the two other schedulers. It works by waiting for a tick generated by a hardware timer and then starts executing all tasks from the beginning. The order of the task matters if there is dependency between the tasks but also to make sure the task requiring the most precise timing is at the beginning of the list of the tasks. All tasks have to be finished executing before the next tick is giving in order to avoid timing is ruined.
\end{itemize}
The RTCS was chosen since it provides timing without the overhead created when doing context-switching and the need of mutex and semaphores. It further reduces the code-complexity.\\

It was decided to implement the code in tasks to make a low coupling between the functionalities. This makes it easier to maintain and expand later of if needed. The task diagram shown in figure \ref{fig:task_diagram_atmega} shows the tasks and how they do intertask communication.

\subsubsection*{Test of RTCS timing}
In order to test the timing of the scheduler, a led\_task was written. The task can be seen in code \ref{code:test_scheduler}
\begin{lstlisting}[language = c, caption = RTCS task used in timing test, label=code:test_scheduler]
void is_alive_task(uint8_t my_state){

	// Write to UART0
	UDR0 = my_state+'0';

	switch(my_state){
	case 0:
		INT_LED_ON_GREEN;
		INT_LED_OFF_RED;
		INT_LED_OFF_BLUE;
	    set_state( 1 );
		break;
	case 1:
		INT_LED_OFF_GREEN;
		INT_LED_ON_RED;
		INT_LED_OFF_BLUE;
	    set_state( 2 );
		break;
	case 2:
		INT_LED_OFF_GREEN;
		INT_LED_OFF_RED;
		INT_LED_ON_BLUE;

		// Set next state
	    set_state( 0 );
		break;
	}
	// Wait one second
	wait( 1000 );
}
\end{lstlisting}

The test was done by writing the current state of the task to UART0.\\ A python script were made that measures the time between each character received. The script can be seen in code \ref{code:test_rtcs_python}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = python, caption = Python code used to measure time between received byte, label=code:test_rtcs_python]
#!/usr/bin/python
import serial
import time

ser = serial.Serial( port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=57600 )

t = time.time()
while True:
    char =  ser.read(1):
    print time.time() - t, ","
    t = time.time()

ser.close()
\end{lstlisting}
The output of the script were redirected to a file. After receiving 700 bytes the standard deviation and mean was calculated using matlab.
The mean is 1.0089 sec with a standard deviation of 0.0042 sec.

Part of the variance is caused by the inaccuracy of the timing on the PC running the python code. If a more accurate measure was needed, a scope could be attached to the $\mu$C's GPIO. Each time the scheduler enters the task the GPIO should be set high, and when it exists the GPIO should be set low. The scopes at SDU is capable of telling the variance of the off signal. \\
It can be concluded that the scheduler performs well.
