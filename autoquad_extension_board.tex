\subsubsection*{Wireless communication module} \label{sec:wireless_communication_module}
An important part of the hardware is the wireless communication used between the PC and the drones.
The wireless communication module has several requirements it needs to fulfill in order to make the whole system work as expected. A comparison table has been made in table \ref{tab:compare_table_wireless_communication} to find the wireless communication module that is best suited for the task. \\
The following wireless modules where considered and compared.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ESP8266}
\end{itemize}

ESP8266 is a generel purpose 32 bit SOC with integrated WIFI 802.11 b/g/n support and buildin TCP/IP stack. It can be setup its own access point or it can connect to an existing wireless network.
It runs at 80MHz and can be flashed with a custom firmware. 
The SOC is sold as modules with different pinouts and features such as extra flash memory \footnote{\url{https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/MOD-WIFI-ESP8266/open-source-hardware}} and different antennas.
The chip has been on the marked for about two years and costs approximately 7\$. 
It has been widely used in DIY-projects due to its low price and because it requires a minimum of network knowledge to get up and running.\footnote{\url{http://www.esp8266.com/} - 43.000 posts in forum} When the SOC is shipped, it comes with a preloaded firmware which either accepts AT commands or LUA scripting depending on the version of the module. These simple programming interfaces makes it quick and easy to interface the cheap. \\
This leads to a large community where most of the problems have been found and solved already. Arduino has been ported to ESP8266 which makes it even easier to get it up and running. Their official Arduino GitHub has 2125 commits on their master branch at the time of writing\footnote{\url{https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino}} \\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{EMW3165}
\end{itemize}
EMW3165 is a SOC much like the ESP8266 supporting 802.11 b/g/n WIFI with buildin TCP/IP stack. As with ESP8266 it supports setting up an access point aswell as connecting to an existing network. It has a Cortex-M4 $\mu$C which run at 100MHz. 
It supports custom firmware and can be aswell be bought as different modules with different pinouts and antennas.
It differentiates itself from the ESP8266 by its higher frequency its 5 volts compatible pins \footnote{\url{https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/emw3165.pdf}} which makes it easier to connect other hardware which run 5 volt without the need of a logic level shifter. It has been on the marked for only one year and costs approximately 9\$. Since it is a newer board than ESP8266 it has not been used in the same number of applications and thereby has a smaller community behind\footnote{\url{http://www.emw3165.com/} - 200 posts in forum }. Their most active GitHub has 147 commits on their master branch at the time of writing\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SmartArduino/WiFiMCU}}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{nRF51822}
\end{itemize}
nRF51822 is also a SOC, but it is using Bluetooth instead of WIFI. The nRF51822 $\mu$C is implementing BLE which is a power efficient way of sending and receiving data. The chip supports broadcasting which could be used in this project. The $\mu$C can be bought as a standalone component or mounted on modules as the two other $\mu$Cs. Different modules offers different types of antenna connectors or buildin antenna on the PCB. It has not been possible to find an Arduino ported firmware that supports this $\mu$C. To write a firmware for the $\mu$C it has to be done using Nordic Semiconductor's proprietary SDK. 


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{XBee}
\end{itemize}
XBee is a module that implements the Zbee standard. The Xbee modules work as a wireless serial connection. The Xbee modules supports mesh networking which means the modules by themself figure out which module is closest and makes the connection. This idea makes sense in this application since there will be multiple drones and one computer. If one drone gets too far from the PC, it can just connect to one of the other drones closer to the PC.\\
The Xbee solution is ready to use and requires a minimum of programming to get up and running. The modules also support GPIO for digital in and output and analog input.

\end{table}
    \end{savenotes}

The products compared in \ref{tab:compare_table_wireless_communication} are chosen to have approximately same specs such as onboard antenna and no need for extra components.
The ESP8266 module based on the highest score but must of all because it is use in a wide range of applications and has a lot of activity on their official Arduino github. The weight of the module was measured after the decision was made. If it was heavier than the other modules it would still have been used due to the large number of projects using this module. In case help was needed to make the module work, plenty of projects is available online and they have an active forum\footnote{\url{http://www.esp8266.com/} last visited 26 Maj}

\subsubsection*{Microcontroller}
The list below shows the requirement for the microcontroller on the extension-board.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CAN-controller} to communicate with the AQ M4 board.
	\item \textbf{2 UART} to communicate with the ESP8266-module and with a PC for debugging purpose.
	\item \textbf{Small package} such as QFN64 (9*9mm)
\end{itemize}

The AT90CAN128 was chosen since the author and SDU had experience programming and using that microcontroller. It meets the requirements as well since it has built-in CAN controller,  two UARTS and is available in QFN64 package.
Kjeld Jensen has been in front of the development of the Frobomind-controller\footnote{\url{http://www.frobomind.org/index.php/FMCtrl:FroboMind\_Controller} last visited 22 Maj}, which uses the AT90CAN128 microcontroller.
Since the Frobomind-controller was available the author could start developing the firmware while the PCB for the ladybirds were made.

\subsubsection*{Block Schematic}
The block schematic shown in figure \ref{fig:PCB_block} was created by the author. It was then given to Carsten Albertsen who created the schematic and did rest of the creation of the PCB. Some time was spend  debugging since there was an error in the ISP pins. Later on the author had to make a correction to the board since a pin(GPIO15) on the ESP8266 that had to be grounded in order to select booting from the flash.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/PCB_block_v3.eps}
    \caption{Block schematic of the extension-board developed to AQ M4. It can be seen that the ESP8266 chip is connected to the At90CAN128 using UART1 and that the At90CAN128 is connected to a CAN-transceiver.}
    \label{fig:PCB_block}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Pins}
A few pins where made available through solder pads for easy access if needed later on.

The following pins where available as solder pads:
\begin{itemize}
	\item PortF 0 - Alternative function as ADC, channel 0
	\item PortD 0 - Alternative function as interrupt, INT0 and I2C, SCL
	\item PortD 1 - Alternative function as interrupt, INT1 and I2C, SDA
\end{itemize}
In case the onboard barometer is not accurate enough to keep the drone at a constant height, an alternative distance could be used to measure the drones altitude with respect to the ground.
PortF0 has been made available since some distance sensors give output as an analogue value. 
An example of such sensor is an Infrared proximity sensor.\footnote{\url{http://www.sharpsma.com/webfm\_send/1208}} \\
As an alternative type of distance sensor, a ultrasoinc could be used such as HCSR04.
As output it gives a binary output with high-time proportional with the distance.\footnote{\url{http://www.micropik.com/PDF/HCSR04.pdf}}.
To detect the high-time, one of PortD1/0 would be useful.
Sensors using I2C could be used as well.\\
Which type of sensor suits best as a distance sensor to provide altitude information to the drone is ouf of scope of this report. The PCB has just been made ready to support different types of sensors.

\subsubsection*{Debug/ISP}
In the final schematic \ac{UART}0 and ISP pins where combined in one pinheader for easy access through one cable.
The connector can be seen in figure \ref{fig:extension_board}.

To program the At90CAN128 the ISP pins where required to be easy accessable. 
\ac{UART}0 was made accessable to be used as debug and programming of the ESP8266 board.
The idea was to setup the At90CAN128 as \ac{UART} passthrough from \ac{UART}0 to \ac{UART}1.
Due to a mistake \footnote{The wrong pair of MISO/MOSI pins where made available in the ISP-header. The correct pair of MISO/MOSI is also RXD0/TXD0 as alternative function} in the final schematic\footnote{Can be found at \textit{Appendix/ESP8266\_CAN\_Autoquad29032016\_3.PDF}}, both \ac{UART}0 and \ac{UART}1 where made accessible trough the ISP/debug header. 
This ended up making it easier to program the ESP8266-board without using the At90CAN128 as \ac{UART} pass-through.

\begin{figure}[H]

        \label{fig:extension_board_down}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Top and bottom view of the extension-board}\label{fig:extension_board}
\end{figure}

Test of the extension-board was done by making small sketches testing the individual parts of the circuit. The sketches used to blink the leds and proof that the basic functionality works is left out. CAN is tested in section \ref{sec:test_of_queues}.

\subsubsection*{Test of WIFI range}
A test of the WIFI was conducted in order to test the range of the ESP8266 module. 

To make the test, the firmware of the ESP8266 module had to be flashed to specify which access point \footnote{The network configuration is described in  section \ref{sec:network_configuration}} it should connect to.
The tests were conducted on an open grass field in order to avoid as much disturbance as possible.

The first test was conducted by pinging the module from the authors laptop 200 times, 10 hz with a packet size equal to the size of the frame used.\footnote{The WIFI frame is described in section \ref{sec:system_architecture_indoor}}. The purpose of the test was to see how the latency behaves when the distance is increased and at what distance the  WIFI-connection is dropped.

Figure \ref{fig:wifi_pingtest} shows the results of the ping test.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/wifi_test_latency_1.eps}
  \caption{Plot shows the latency, packet loss vs. distance. Up until 46 meters no packets are dropped and the latency is quite low.}
    \label{fig:wifi_pingtest}
\end{figure}

It can be seen, that until 46 Meters no packets is dropped and the latency is low. From 46 to 69 the latency starts to increase and packets begin to get dropped. At 69 meters and up to 80 meters the latency is high and packet loss percentage is increased. Since ping works by sending a request and waiting for the answer this tests communication both ways. However only one way communication from the laptop to the ESP8266 is required.

Another test was done where the authors laptop sends valid frames\footnote{Frame described in section \ref{sec:system_architecture_indoor}} with CRC\footnote{CRC described in section \ref{sec:extension_board_firmware}} to the ESP8266 module. The tests shows for how long a distance the module can be from the laptop and still receive valid packets. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{graphics/crc_distance_check.eps}
	\caption{Measurements was initially done at every meter, however to save time the distance was increase to 5 meter and later to 10. When packets began to drop, measurements was done at 5 meter interval again. At 100 meters the WIFI connection was dropped.}
    \label{fig:wifi_crc_check}
\end{figure}

At figure \ref{fig:wifi_pingtest} and \ref{fig:wifi_crc_check} it can be seen, that at a distance higher than 46 meters the latency increases but almost every CRC packet is received and valid. At 90 meters the number of valid frames drops and a ping response is not received. Even though frames it still received and valid they will be delayed.


A final test was made to see how the modules behave when two modules are receiving the packets. At 10 hz 200 frames were sent to two modules at a distance of 10 meters.
Unfortunately only one connector to communicate with the extension-board were made which made it difficult to check if both extension-boards received the data without error at the same time. The test was done 4 times while alternating between the modules to verify both modules were receiving all the packets.\footnote{If more time were available, a timing-test of the setup would have been done. By measuring the time it takes one drones to receive 200 packets, do the same test but when two drones each receiving 200 packets.}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/laptop_extenbioard_crc_check}
        \caption{Test setup where two modules receives 200 frames at 10 hz at the same time. It can be seen that the laptop only checks the received number of frames one extension-board at a time.}
        \label{fig:crc_distance_check}
\end{figure}
Both modules received 200 packets without CRC error 

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}
The ESP8266 wireless module was chosen based on requirements in table \ref{compare_table_wireless_communication}. The ESP8266 got the highest score and was chosen since it is a widely used module. The extension-board was created based on the block schematic shown in figure \ref{fig:PCB_block}. Three tests was conducted to test the performance of ESP8266 module. If the distance is higher than 46 meters the latency begins to increase and the CRC packets will be delayed.
