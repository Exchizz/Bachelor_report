The current AutoQuad does not support vision as source of 2D position which is required for the indoor Leader-follower to work. The relative height of the drone is measured using the build-in barometer in each drone providing the third dimension to the drones position. In case the barometer turns out to be too inaccurate due to drift other sensors might be used e.g ultrasound. A PCB for each drone has to be developed for the drones to carry as payload. The PCB will be responsible for receiving messages from the computer and translate them into the CAN-bus of the drone.
