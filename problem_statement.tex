The current AutoQuad version does not support any other source of global positioning than the onboard GPS and thereby does not accurate support flying within 3 cm\footcite{stempfhuber2011precise}. For AutoQuad to be used in applications requiring high accuracy this functionality is needed. \\
RTK-GPSs are unfortunately very expensive especially when they are small enough to be mounted on a drone. In order to add this functionality to AutoQuad, an indoor environment needs to be created in case of code behaving unexpected. Instead of using RTK-GPS indoor, a indoor positioning system will be developed. This test environment might be used later on to test swarm, navigation and control algorithms
