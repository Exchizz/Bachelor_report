Used git - used one git repo at the beginning but due to messy history it was later on split into x repos. The ideal solution would be to use branches but then again it is nice to keep code for PC, drone and WIFI separate and not mix it with the report.

Required materials for this project:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 4 AutoQuad Ladybird drones. 
	\item 1 FullHD camera
	\item 4 PCBs with MicroController, CAN-transiver and wireless communication
	\item Test facilities
	\item 4 Markers, one for each drone
	\item Software
	\item MarkerLocator(https://github.com/henrikmidtiby/MarkerLocator )
	\item Python-can package
	\item ST-LINK v2. Used for debugging AutoQuad
	\item PEAK-CAN adapter, used during development
	\item A computer running linux
\end{itemize}
