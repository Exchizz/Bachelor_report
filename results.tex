\section{WIFI latency and range} \label{sec:result_wifi_range_ping}
Figure \ref{fig:wifi_pingtest} shows the results of the ping test.

  \caption{Plot shows the latency, packet loss vs. distance. Up until 46 meters no packets are dropped and the latency is quite low.}

	\caption{Measurements was initially done at every meter, however to save time the distance was increase to 5 meter and later to 10. When packets began to drop, measurements was done at 5 meter interval again. At 100 meters the WIFI connection was dropped.}
