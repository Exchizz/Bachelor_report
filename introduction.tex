\textit{This chapter will give the reader background information about UAVs and point out a problem SDU is currently facing in two ongoing projects. Further more it will describe the focus of this project and how others have managed to solve it.}
\subsection*{Background}
UAS is an emerging technology used in lots of different areas\cite{gupta2013review}.

Especially quadroters also refereed to as multiroters have started to gain a lot of attention. This is, among other reasons, because it has become cheaper to produce the hardware needed to build a quadroters. Microcontrollers have become powerful enough in order to make it possible to implement control and navigation algorithms on a quadroters.\cite{gibiansky2010quadcopter}

%A multiroter works by having three or more rotors mounted with equal distance from the centrum of the multiroter.
%Not all roters of the multiroter spins the same way in order to compensate for the torque generated by the multiroter.
%A multiroter is usually equipped with a flight controller, battery, three or more electronic speed controllers and rotors.
%The multirotor balances using its flight controller that controls the velocity and thereby the thrust of each rotor. Usually a rotor is brushless which means it has three phases that needs to be turned on and off, so called commutation, at the right time. The job of the Electric Speed Controller is to do the commutation depending on the speed sent from the flight controller. 

One of the challenge concerning multirotors is the amount of energy they are capable of carrying. If the drone is equipped with a heavy camera or other kind of payload, then the flight time begins to decrease. 
By looking at the nature, one can see how small animals like ants and birds manage to cooperate and thereby build or move bigger things that they would not be able to do on their own. This way of small independent, decentralized units working together is called a swarm\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm\_intelligence}}.
By making multirotors smaller, they get more efficient, their flight time increase and they get cheaper but of the cost of their ability to lift\cite{1_kumar_2016}. Therefore an idea would be to make small multirotors cooperate to solve more heavy and complex tasks. 

Multirotors can be used in a wide range of applications.
If the multirotor is equipped with a camera it can quickly provide an overview of a fence, wiring, lamps etc. Multiroters is usually used in applications outside which among other reasons, might be caused by the requirement of GPS signal being available.
Most multicopters are capable of flying indoor however they often has little knowledge about where they are since they lack GPS indoor. It limits the applications multirotors can be used for indoor. 
A research project named UAWORLD has just started which will focus on doing indoor flying.\footnote{\url{http://innovationsfonden.dk/da/case/droner-rykker-indendoers-med-dansk-teknologi-0}}. They will focus on making multirotors robust and safe enough in order to let multirotors fly indoor. They are going to develop the system in cooperation with GamesOnTrack.com which delivers the indoor 3D localization system. GamesOnTrack's localization system uses beacons and triangulation to localize objects.\footnote{More information is not available online} The are sure that drones will be used indoor at hotels, hospitals, schools and offices. 

The GPS available outdoor has an accuracy of 3.5 meter \footnote{http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/} which might be adequate depending on the applications. In most flight controllers, the GPS is fused with onboard sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope however the positioning is still not adequate if the multirotor is supposed to fly close to an object within centimeters. 

Even though GPS is usually available outdoor there might be places where no GPS signal is available eg. In forests or cities with high buildings. 
In indoor as well as outdoor applications where absolute positioning is required but GPS is not available alternative solutions such as radio triangulation, vision or totalstations could be used. 
However most of the multiroters available on the marked only supports using their build-in GPS which might be a limitation if GPS is not available but accurate flying is necessary.


At the time of writing, SDU is collaborating with HCA airport to find anomalies in fences.\\ 
\textit{Airports are burdened by a number of required inspection tasks to maintain a high level of safety and security.
Some of these tasks may advantageously be performed by a drone rather than manually, as is is currently, and save time and resources.
In this project they are targeting a specific need for frequent inspection of the fence surrounding the airport shown in figure \ref{fig:hca_fence}. 
The inspection concerns fence holes or similar anomalies. We hypothesize that a drone is 
capable of unsupervised autonomous inspecting the airport fence detecting small holes down 
to a radius of 5 cm.} \footnote{Application sent to Energi Fyns Udviklingsfond which has been granted, Ansøgning 2015-01-30 Energi Fyns Udviklingsfond-1.pdf on USB}

In order to avoid flying into the fence and to fly accurate enough for the camera to film, it is required to have an vertical accuracy of 2-3 cm \footnote{Henrik Egemose Schmidt - Drone inspection of fences}

In another project, SDU is working together with Ecobotix ApS, Aarhus Univercity and EWH BioProduction ApS, to avoid the need of pesticides in organic crops. Pesticides are  chemical substances used to kill pests from the crops. When using pesticides a health risks exists for those who eat the crops. The use of pesticides also reduce the amount of diversity in nature since it is also killing beneficial organisms and potentially harm other animals in the food chain like birds. If nothing is used the crops might die, and that is very expensive to the farmer. The project has been granted 8.356.126 kr. from GUDP \footnote{\url{http://naturerhverv.dk/tvaergaaende/gudp/gudp-projekter/2015/oekodrone-skal-sprede-mariehoens-i-stedet-for-pesticider/} last visited 18-04-2016}\\
They intend to use multirotors to spread bugs like ladybirds and gall midges, over the crops to eat pests as shown in fugure \ref{fig:organicdrone}. \\
It is required the drones fly approximately 1 meter above ground at 1.5 meter/sec. It is therefore necessary to use an RTK-GPS in order to avoid hitting the ground in case of bumps in the fields. \footnote{Jensen, K.; Larsen, R.; Laursen M.S.; Neerup, M.M.; Skriver, M. and Jørgensen, R.N. Towards UAV contour flight over agricultural fields using RTK-GNSS and a Digital Height Model. Accepted for oral presentation at CIGR-AgEng June 2016.}\\


Many different flight controllers exists on the marked. SDU UAS has decided to use AutoQuad since, among other reasons, the code is Open Source \footnote{Quatos, which is their control algorithm is not Open Source.} and the multiroters show reliable and steady flying. An AutoQuad multiroter delivered by ViaCopter\footnote{\url{https://viacopter.eu/}} usually comes with with the AutoQuad flight controller M4, Electronic Speed Controllers( ESC32 ) and rotors. One of ViaCopters smallest drones is delivered without Electronic Speed Controllers since H-bridges used to control the velocity of the motors are build into the M4 flight controller.
ViaCopter can deliver drones in different sizes but their flight controller is the same. This means that code developed for ViaCopters Ladybird can be deployed on a large drone and it will continue to work\footnote{Assumed the developer did not break important lowlevel tasks}. However AutoQuad does not support any other source of absolute positioning other than using its onboard GPS. \\

Because of the research-projects at SDU, there is a need for being able
