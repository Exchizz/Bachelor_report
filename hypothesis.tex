If each drone's 2D position is obtained using indoor localization and spoofed into a AutoQuad Ladybird over CAN with 5 hz, then it is possible for at least 3 drones to follow a leader-drone with a preprogrammed flight path and keep an euclidean distance at 50 cm within $\pm$10 cm to the leader and its neighbors.
