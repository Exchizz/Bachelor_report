If each droneâ€™s 2D position is obtained using indoor localization and sent into each drone using CAN at the same frequency as an onboard GPS, then it is possible for at least 3 drones to follow a leader drone with a preprogrammed flight path and keep a distance of 50 cm within plus minus 10 cm to the leader and its neighbours.
