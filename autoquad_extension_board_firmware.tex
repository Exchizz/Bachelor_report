\textit{In this chapter the development of the firmwares running on the extension board is described. Different types of schedulers for the At90CAN128 is discussed and a scheduler is chosen and developed with the required functionality. Furthermore the firmware running on the ESP8266 is described. Several tests are conducted to test if it works}

\textbf{Conclusion} \\
It can be concluded that by selecting a \ac{RTCS} it was possible to run a task every second with a mean and standard deviation of 1.0089 and 0.0042 sec. respectively. By creating a task-diagram it was possible to design a modular firmware for the At90CAN128 and to use queues as communication between the tasks. Furthermore a small firmware without a scheduler for the EPS8266 module were written.
